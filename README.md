## About Project

We will be solving the problems of farmers and covering a total of three Sustainable Development Goals listed on [UN website](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

## The Idea

We will create a system, mobile application preffered, which will guide and make a community of farmers. Farmers can use this system to maximise their yield and financial growth in a sustainable and productive way.

## Sustainable Development Goals:
- [No Poverty](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1).<br>
    <p>In countries like India farmers are not getting what they deserve. They do not have direct connections to the buyers hence, this leads the interference of brokers. Most of the money is snapped in the deal without any records. But, this application can provide a direct connection between a farmer and buyer. Therefore, this will eliminate the need of intermediate brokers.</p>
- [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2).<br>
    <p>According to UN statical data in 2020 a staggering 2.4 billion people, or above 30 per cent of the worldâ€™s population, were moderately or severely food-insecure, lacking regular access to adequate food.This may be noted that zero hunger is related to farming in many ways. Once we have efficient way of growing crops we can reduce these horrible numbers by leaps and bounds. Our system will provide assistance to all users for growing the crop in the most efficient way depending upon their geolocation addresses.</p>
- [Decent work and Economic Growth](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8).<br>
    <p>The elimination of brokers and other intermediates in the process of selling crops will lead to overall financial growth of both the farmers as well as the nation. And the assistance provided by our systems will lead to efficiency in work and man power.</p>

## Stack
Here is the best stack I could think of. Any suggestions are welcomed<br><br>
<img alt="Flutter" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-storage-bucket/c823e53b3a1a7b0d36a9.png">
<h1>Flutter</h1>
<p>For app development flutter is the best choice as it is developed by Google and one of the best framework out there for app development moreover, we can produce Android, iOS and web application using single codebase.</p><br><br><br><br>

<img alt="Firebase" src="https://www.gstatic.com/devrel-devsite/prod/vf835aa6b9cd89b3f27e5e46b762d88066cfe5cc51e31c466c45c27dbcd2bcca1/firebase/images/lockup.svg"><br><br>
<h1>Firebase</h1>
<p>Another super and easy to use technology by Google. Mainly used for authentication and database. We can use this as our Back-end stack. We can also use back-end frameworks like Laravel,django etc. if needed.</p><br><br><br><br>
